# Learning Git

What is Git?

Git is a tool that helps people manage and keep track of changes to their work, especially when multiple people are involved. Imagine you're writing a book, and instead of just one version, you have many drafts or versions over time. Git acts like a super-smart filing system for all those drafts.
